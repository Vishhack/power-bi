## UK Road Accident Analysis)

### Problem Statement
As a beginner in data analytics, the objective of this assignment is to analyze the UK road accident dataset and gain insights into factors affecting road safety and accident severity. By examining the dataset, we aim to explore various aspects of road accidents and address the following questions. By addressing these questions and conducting exploratory analysis on the UK road accident dataset, we aim to gain insights into road safety and accident prevention. The analysis will be conducted using Advanced Power BI visualizations and filters to provide an interactive and insightful dashboard.

### Dashboard Components

1. **Total Casualties and Average Speed Limit:**
   - Calculate and visualize the total number of casualties and the average speed limit across all accidents.

2. **Police Force with the Highest Number of Reported Accidents:**
   - Identify the police force with the highest number of reported accidents to understand regional variations in accident frequency.

3. **Districts with More than 1000 Reported Accidents:**
   - Determine the districts where the number of reported accidents exceeds 1000 to identify high-risk areas.

4. **Vehicle Types Involved in the Highest Number of Accidents:**
   - Analyze the vehicle types involved in the highest number of accidents to identify common contributing factors.

5. **Relationship Between Number of Vehicles and Casualties:**
   - Explore the relationship between the number of vehicles involved in an accident and the average number of casualties to understand the impact of multiple vehicle collisions.

6. **Trend of Accidents Over Time:**
   - Analyze the trend of accidents over time, including year, quarter, month, and even day, to identify any patterns or seasonality in accident occurrence.

7. **Common Junction Types Associated with Accidents:**
   - Determine the junction types that are commonly associated with accidents to highlight potential areas for improved road design or safety measures.

8. **Most Affected Districts in Terms of Accidents:**
   - Identify the districts that are most affected by accidents to prioritize targeted interventions and allocate resources effectively.

9. **Effect of Road Surface Conditions on Accident Severity:**
   - Analyze how road surface conditions affect accident severity to understand the importance of road maintenance and surface quality.

10. **Slicers for Accident Severity and District:**
    - Add slicers for accident severity and district to allow users to filter the entire report page based on these parameters.

### Dataset Explanation

The UK road accident dataset contains the following columns:

- **Accident_Index:** A unique identifier or reference number assigned to each accident in the dataset.
- **Accident_Date:** The date when the accident occurred.
- **Day_of_Week:** The day of the week on which the accident took place (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
