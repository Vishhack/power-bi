## Employee Data Analysis

### Problem Statement

In this project, we will perform data analysis on an employee dataset to extract meaningful insights and create new columns that provide additional information. By examining various attributes of the employees, we aim to enhance our understanding of their profiles and characteristics. We will leverage the power of data manipulation and transformation techniques to answer specific questions and derive valuable insights.


### Project Tasks

1. Create a new column called "FullNameLength" to calculate the length of each employee's full name.

2. Create a new column called "JoinMonth" to extract the hire month from the "Hire Date" column.

3. Create a new column called "FullNameUpper" to convert the values in the "Full Name" column to uppercase.

4. Create a new column called "DepartmentCode" to extract and capitalize the department code from the "Department" column.

5. Create a new column called "IsWeekendHire" to determine if an employee was hired on a weekend.

6. Create a new column called "YearsOfService" to calculate the number of years an employee has been with the company.

7. Create a new column called "FirstName" to extract the first name from the "Full Name" column.

8. Create a new column called "LastName" to extract the last name from the "Full Name" column.

9. Create a new column called "AgeGroup" to categorize employees into "Youth," "Adult," or "Senior" based on their age.

10. Create a new column called "BonusAmount" to calculate the bonus amount for each employee.

11. Create a new table called 'HighPaidEmp' to store details of employees with an annual salary greater than or equal to 100000.

12. Create a new column called "JoiningYear" to extract the year from the "Hire Date" column.
